## [0.7.0] 2021-10-22

Note: several of of these changes is are major updates and may break some backwards compatibility.
There may still be some minor bugs in the implementation and there are more comparison tests to
perform, but the avoid further unwieldy MRs these have been put into a release. This release also
requires a development version of LALSuite, so a Conda installable release of this version will not
be available.

Changes for this release:

- Add command line interface for data heterodyning, including generating HTCondor DAGs (!28)

- Add heterodyned signal simulation class into CWInPy rather than using LALSuite version (!46, !55)
- Add a histogram distribution to the hierarchical analysis (!48)
- Fix how the KDE bandwidth is calculated in the hierarchical analysis (!49)
- Change the way packaging/versioning of the code is done (!52)

**Important note**: HDF5 files created from `HeterodynedData` objects using earlier versions of
CWInPy will no longer be compatible with v0.6.0 and will fail to be read.

- Add the use of `pre-commits` for developers (!10).
